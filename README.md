●	An automated home control system built collaboratively, that activates upon using the Home-E mobile application or a 13.56 MHz high frequency RFID key.
●	Assembled subsystems that identify an RFID key’s UID while serially interfacing with a display system, and connect via Bluetooth to trigger a door latch and an air-freshener.
●	Hardware used: HC-O5 Bluetooth Modules, MG996R Servo Motors, RFID Kit MFRC522, Arduino UNO R3
